# Open‑Core Documentation (Trimmed)

This repository follows an open‑core model:

- Core protocol and Solana program are open and permissively licensed.
- Proprietary extensions (data pipelines, dashboards, integrations) live out of tree.
- No vendor lock‑in, no proprietary dependencies in the core.

Scope retained here:
- Minimal architecture notes in `README.md`
- Public interfaces and on‑chain types in `programs/attention-oracle`
- Reference client helpers under `clients/` (if present)

Redacted/removed from history:
- Internal runbooks, system checklists, and incident reports
- Environment files, keys, and secrets
- Infra deployments and vendor‑specific scripts

Contributions welcome for the open‑core surface area only.
